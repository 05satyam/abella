README for Abella
=================
Please report all bugs, feature request, and comments to Andrew Gacek
(andrew.gacek@gmail.com).


Quick Start
===========

  1. Compile the program by running "make" from the root directory.
  
  2. Start Abella, passing in the name of the specification file to
     reason about. For example, ./abella examples/eval.mod
     
  3. Consult with the corresponding thm files (e.g. examples/eval.thm)
     for examples of theorems and their proofs. Type in the examples
     by hand or run them in batch mode using the -f flag. Most thm
     files also have a short description of what is being proven.
