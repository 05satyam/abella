The Schematics Polymorphism Branch
==================================

This is the branch of Abella that supports schematic polymorphism. You
can find examples showing the capabilities and limitations of
schematic polymorphism in the directory
'examples/schm-poly'. Currently, this directory contains the following
examples:

1. A definition of the append relation at the reasoning level and the
proof of its determinacy (reasoning-append.thm). This example
demonstrates how to reason about schematic definitions defined at the
reasoning level.

2. A definition of the append relation at the specification level and
the proof of its determinacy (spec-append.thm). This example
demonstrates how to reason about schematic definitions defined at the
specification level.

3. Examples showing the limitations of schematic polymorphism
(schm-poly-fails.thm).


Quick Start
===========

Compile Abella by running "make" from the root directory. This will
create the binary "abella" (on Unix-like systems, including Mac OS X),
or "abella.exe" (on Windows). This binary can be freely copied
anywhere.

Use the following walkthrough for an introduction to using Abella:
