This week
=========

Add tests for proof obligations because of _ in apply_forall

Clean up code for freshness in tactics
  And freshen in test_helper

Clean up case code with labelled args?

Clean up how meta clauses are added to meta_clause?

Add more bedwyr style searching?
  Watch timestamps more closely?
  Change not (try_left_unify ...) so unification errors (not failures)
    do not result in success

Redo cut elimination proof?
    
Next week
=========

Add equivariant unification

Where do we add raising over supp(T)?

With support for contexts and names,
     Dale's copy example
     Dale's normal example
     Dale's substitution example
     Cut elimination with forall quantifier

     
Future
======

Merge clauses and command into a general data structure file?

Do we have to consider logic variables in the context during search?
How does object cut work with contexts?

Add 'and'

Fix rigid_path_check

Add unification over lppterms?
  If so then simplify search, case, and apply_forall

Make omake target that checks all thm files with their mod files

Make omakefile target for any mod/thm combination

Think about timestamps in the bedwyr style searching

Flatten ndcore into src?

Create extensions module which extends the standard libraries with
missing functions


Larger or longer term issues
============================
Remove duplication between case analysis and searching

Fix all substitution capture issues with replace_lppterm_vars
      "Replace should not capture exists variables" >::
        (fun () ->
           let t = exists ["A"] b in
           let t' = replace_lppterm_vars [("B", var_a)] t in
             assert_pprint_equal "exists A', {A}" t') ;

Use type information from sig files?

Seperate parsers more?

Change OMakefile so exceptions print full stack trace? Is there a way
  to integrate this with OUnit?

Add real support for non-interactive mode
  Halt on errors
  Echo commands

Add a show_lemmas command
Add 'abort'

Add warning if using a capital name without it appearing in forall
  e.g. forall A, {rev A B} -> {rev B A}. should warn about B.
