Clean up context_pair code in apply_forall
Fix issue where hyp B2 comes before hyp B1 in Forall application with
contexts
Why is hyp C1 come before L in Theorem imp_inv?

Case should look in context as a subcase.
  case on {L, hyp A |- hyp C} should have
    hyp C -in- L
    hyp C = hyp A ?

Add support for multiple inductive restrictions again?

Do cut elimination proof

Case should look in context as a subcase

Add support for linc predicates like ctxpair and neg

With support for contexts, do the cut elimination proof

Add equivariant unification

Where do we add raising over supp(T)?

With support for contexts and names,
     Dale's copy example
     Dale's normal example
     Dale's substitution example
     Cut elimination with forall quantifier

Do we have to consider logic variables in the context during search?
How does object cut work with contexts?

Add 'and'

Fix rigid_path_check

Make omake target that checks all thm files with their mod files

Move things from prover to tactics if they use Tactics.foo

Make omakefile target for any mod/thm combination


Larger or longer term issues
============================
Remove duplication between case analysis and searching

Fix all substitution capture issues with replace_lppterm_vars
      "Replace should not capture exists variables" >::
        (fun () ->
           let t = exists ["A"] b in
           let t' = replace_lppterm_vars [("B", var_a)] t in
             assert_pprint_equal "exists A', {A}" t') ;

Use type information from sig files?

Seperate parsers more?

Change OMakefile so exceptions print full stack trace? Is there a way
  to integrate this with OUnit?

Allow forall application with OR on the left

Add a show_lemmas command
Add 'abort'

Add warning if using a capital name without it appearing in forall
  e.g. forall A, {rev A B} -> {rev B A}. should warn about B.
