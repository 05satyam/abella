%% Tait's logical relations argument
%%
%% Tait's logical relations argument for proving normalization for the
%% simply typed lambda calculus. This is based on the presentation in
%% Types and Programming Languages by Pierce.

%% Conventions:
%% Types: A, B, C
%% Terms: M, N, P, R
%% Values (Terms): V
%% Contexts: L, K


Define halts M := exists V, {nstep M V} /\ {value V}.

%% Reduce is the logical relation used to prove normalization.
%%
%% This definition uses itself recursively in a negative context (the
%% left side of an implication). In order to guarantee consistency of
%% the system we must ensure this definition is stratified. Note the
%% second argument to reduce is strictly smaller in the (negative)
%% recursive occurrence, thus the definition is indeed stratified.

Define reduce M top := {of M top} /\ halts M.
Define reduce M (arrow A B) :=
  {of M (arrow A B)} /\
  halts M /\
  (forall N, reduce N A -> reduce (app M N) B).

%% Now we need to state the generalize theorem. This will require reasoning
%% about all possible closed instantiations of an open term.

% Suppose that {L |- of M A} is true. Then M is an open term with nominal
% constants that are listed in L. The judgment "subst L M N" holds for all
% instantiations N of the nominal constants in M with values that satisfy
% the reduce relation for their respective types. The key to defining this
% judgment is the use of nabla in the head of a definition which extracts
% a nominal constant from L and M. The definition of subst then substitutes
% for this nominal constant and continues processing the list L.
