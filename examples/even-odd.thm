%% Proof that every natural number is even or odd
%%
%% This is a simple example where induction is needed at a nested rather
%% than immediate recursive call.

Define nat z.
Define nat (s N) := nat N.

Define even z.
Define even (s (s N)) := even N.

Define odd (s z).
Define odd (s (s N)) := odd N.
