Changes in 2.0.2 from 2.0.1
---------------------------

Potentially breaking changes.

* Constants with names matching n[0-9]+ are forcibly treated as
  nominal constants. This fixes a unsoundness due to ambiguous
  parsing of such constants in proofs.
* The tactic "exists" now has a synonym: "witness". This adds
  "witness" to the list of keywords.

Additions

* Specification language now supports <= in addition to =>
* Binders are printed using variable naming hints from the
  source instead of in a normalized form (x1, x2, etc.)
* Can unfold the nth clause of an inductive or co-inductive
  definition block using "unfold n".
* Can name clauses in the specification (in .mod files) using a
  comment of the form %:nm: right before a clause. There must be a
  single Abella identifier and no spaces between the two :s.
* Can unfold a specific clause named "nm" of a specification using
  "unfold nm".
* New flag "instantiations" shows variable instantiations at the top
  of a subgoal.
* New notation "~ F" for "F -> false".
* The backchain tactic now allows backchaining formulas that are
  not prenex-quantified implications. The "head" of the backchained
  formula is interpreted as any formula that is not an implication.
* The rename tactic has been extended to also allow renaming
  variables, with an identical syntax.

Internal changes

* Terms and meta-terms now have pretty-printer with a plugin
  architecture for future extensions.

Bug fixes

* The exists/witness tactics now rename to avoid capture (#22)
* Raising over nominal constants in spec. sequents raises over the
  support of the whole sequent rather than just its conclusion.
* Normalizing of binders now avoid capture (#23)
* Instantiated variables are no longer printed in the variables list
  of a sequent.
* Higher-order definitions have a stricter stratification check that
  complains both about actual and potential unsound definitions.
* The subordination checker now does not complain about invalid
  subterms for types that have not been explicitly Closed.
* The rename tactic cannot rename lemmas (i.e., theorems proved
  earlier)

New examples

* Formalization of the meta-theory of higher-order HH using only the
  reasoning logic of Abella (examples/logic/hh_meta.thm).
